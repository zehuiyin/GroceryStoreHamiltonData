# geog712package

<!-- badges: start -->

This package is an activity completed by [Zehui Yin](https://zehuiyin.github.io/) for the course [GEOG 712 Reproducible Research Workflow with GitHub and R](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course.php?catoid=55&coid=274877), taught by [Dr. Antonio Paez](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/paezha) in Fall 2024.

## Installation

You can install the development version of geog712package from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){
    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)
}
remotes::install_github("zehuiyin/geog712package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(geog712package)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
multiplier(2, 3)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(437)
v <- rnorm(100)
plot(multiplier(v, 3), multiplier(v, -1) + rnorm(100))
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
