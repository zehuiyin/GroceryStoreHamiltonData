# Load packages

The *sf* package is used to handle vector spatial data.

```{r setup}

# `grocery_CT` data

Load and plot the `grocery_CT` vector data. This dataset contains the geometry of all the census tracts in Hamilton and includes two variables: the population count in 2021 and the grocery store counts in each census tract.

```{r}
data("grocery_CT")
plot(grocery_CT[ ,"v_CA21_1..Population..2021"],
     main = "2021 Population Count")
plot(grocery_CT[ ,"Freq"],
     main = "Grocery Store Count")
```

## An OLS simple linear regression of these two variables

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(Freq ~ v_CA21_1..Population..2021, data = grocery_CT)
summary(lm1)
```

Based on this simple regression (p-value = 0.66 > 0.05), the population count is not a significant predictor of the grocery store count in Hamilton.
